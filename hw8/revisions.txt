    I completed the file reading portion of the homework. It was easier than
    expected; all I had to do was make a char* holding all the data from the
    file, then call set_encode and free the char* afterwards. I have
    verified that all the try cases match, and am ready for submission.
    (It's about time I didn't screw one of these up, right?)

    Almost complete! I updated main to properly call the correct function
    when the requested file is present. Again the last step is properly
    reading the bytes from the file. The last step is properly constructing
    the set. So close!

    I wrote the documentation for the program and fixed a minor bug that
    made the program not properly ignore characters that are not supported.
    I also got rid of some magic numbers (64 and 63) and replaced them with
    references to the constants at the top of the file. I tested my program
    with every example except for the one dealing with a file and all
    checked out. The final battle is IO. Wish me luck.

    The program is basically finished minus documentation and dealing with
    the file stuff. Not looking forward to IO, always manages to screw me
    up. I fixed a memory issue with displaying the data in the set after it
    has been processed vis replacing a malloc with a calloc. See you on the
    other side!

    I finished the implimentation of the main functions somehow. All that is
    left is getting input from a file and documentation (and probably a few
    other things from the writeup that I haven't seen yet). I will see you
    on the other side!

    I figured out the proper way to convert a string to the preffered set
    data type. With that, I should be able to quickly impliment the other
    functions. Wish me luck.

    I made the initial skeleton of the program, as well as properly
    formatted output using dummy values. In my next commit I should have
    proper documentation and my first attempt at implimentation for the
    large number of functions at the top of my file.
